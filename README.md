# In-Vehicle-Coupon
Project for Project Group 3

1. Introduction

In this project, we will focus on coupons that are specifically available to the drivers. We will dive into the dataset to explore the characteristics of targeted customers, coupon type, business characteristics, and its successful 
targeting. To correctly identify successful coupon targeting, we will develop several machine models to help businesses to achieve better usage of business resources.

2. Method
In this project, we use three machine learning models to train and classify successful commercial distribution—Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM. 

3.Result
From the graph above, Logistic Regression with Catboost Encoding and Lasso Regularization 
gives the best recall of 83.45%. Therefore, Logistic Regression with Catboost Encoding and 
Lasso Regularization is the model we should choose to distinguish between successful coupon 
distributions and unsuccessful ones. With the help of such a model, businesses will be able to 
find as much as 83% of successful coupon distribution/identify potential target customers. The 
generated revenue well justified the cost of the coupon, achieving a more effective and costsaving advertisement campaign.
